        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p class="text-editorial">
          Property 4D is inspired by Kintsukuroi—the Japanese art of golden repair. 
          We believe that fractures in a property's history don't diminish its value; 
          they enhance it. Every renovation, every change of ownership, every moment 
          of transformation becomes a golden seam in the story of a place.

            <h3>Space</h3>
            <p>
              Navigate properties through an interactive 3D globe. Location is not 
              just coordinates—it's context, culture, and connection.

            <h3>Time</h3>
            <p>
              Track development phases, ownership evolution, and architectural history. 
              See how properties grow and transform across decades.

            <h3>Value</h3>
            <p>
              Understand growth, restoration, and refinement through visual timelines. 
              Watch as repairs and improvements add golden value.

              Luxury, calm, and architectural beauty woven into every interaction. 
              Property 4D is designed to feel timeless.

        <h2>Design Principles</h2>
        <ul class="principles-list">
          <li><strong>Imperfection = Value:</strong> History and repairs are celebrated, not hidden</li>
          <li><strong>Calm Confidence:</strong> Slow, deliberate transitions that feel expensive</li>
          <li><strong>Architectural Thinking:</strong> Every element serves a purpose</li>
          <li><strong>Editorial Quality:</strong> Content that reads like a gallery placard</li>
          <li><strong>Timeless Aesthetic:</strong> White canvas with muted gold accents</li>
